# Tools

Automation of data management, processing, and report generation is far from solved. Much of the process is incomplete, janky, or otherwise frustrating. That said, some good progress has been made and is recognized here.

## Data Management

These tools focus on herding the mountains of data gathered during an engagement and tend to support more flexible workflows.
